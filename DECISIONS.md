# MAST Provisioning — Architecture Decisions

## [2026-05-05] Migrated dev/test environment from VirtualBox to UTM

**Why:** Apple Silicon; VirtualBox on Apple Silicon has limited ARM64 guest support and requires
VirtualBox Guest Additions for shared folder functionality — an additional install step that must
be repeated after Guest Additions updates. UTM runs ARM64 Windows guests natively with better
performance. Critically, UTM's Disposable Mode eliminates the need for explicit `VBoxManage snapshot
restore` commands: the IoT unit VM resets to its clean baseline automatically on every shutdown,
making the test loop (provision → verify → reset → repeat) fully scriptable from the Mac.

**What:**
- UTM **Shared Network** (`192.168.64.0/24`) replaces VirtualBox host-only (`192.168.56.0/24`).
  The Mac host is always `192.168.64.1`; VMs use static IPs `.10` (prov) and `.20` (unit).
- macOS **File Sharing (SMB)** of `~/shared-utm` replaces the VirtualBox Shared Folder
  (`\\vboxsvr\mast-prov`). The prov server mounts `\\192.168.64.1\shared-utm` as `Z:`.
- UTM **Disposable Mode** on the IoT VM replaces `VBoxManage snapshot restore`. Every shutdown
  discards changes; every boot restores the `post-prepare` baseline automatically.
- `run-prov-test.py` is the new Mac-side orchestrator. It drives build → transfer → execute →
  verify → reset cycles via WinRM (`pywinrm`) and UTM VM lifecycle via `utmctl`.

**Implications:**
- No `VBoxManage` commands or VirtualBox Guest Additions needed.
- The two-VM architecture, WinRM-based remote execution, and module manifest design are unchanged.
- The `utmctl` binary is at `/Applications/UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl`. If UTM is not installed
  at the standard path, pass `--utm-unit-vm` and ensure `utmctl` is on `PATH`.
- `vault/utm-creds.json` stores WinRM and SMB credentials (gitignored). See README for format.

## [2026-05-04] Windows 11 ARM64 (retail ISO) for provisioning server VM

**Why:** The Mac host is Apple Silicon. VirtualBox on Apple Silicon runs ARM guests natively; x64
guests require slow emulation. Microsoft's Evaluation Center does not publish an ARM64 eval ISO —
only x64. The standard consumer ARM64 download at
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11arm64 is the only readily available
ARM64 image. Windows runs fully without activation (PowerShell, SMB, WinRM unaffected); only
cosmetic restrictions apply.

**What:** The provisioning server VM uses the ARM64 retail ISO, run unactivated.

**Implications:** No licence cost or renewal needed for the dev/test provisioning server. If a
physical provisioning server is later used, it will be activated normally and this decision becomes
moot.

## [2026-05-04] Two-VM provisioning architecture for VirtualBox dev/test

**Why:** The build script (`build-mast.ps1`) is written for Windows — it uses PowerShell, SMB shares,
`mklink`, and `robocopy`. The host machine is a Mac (Apple Silicon), so the build cannot run natively
on the host. A single Windows IoT target VM cannot safely act as its own provisioning server because
the build mutates the filesystem and could pollute a clean baseline.

**What:** Two separate VirtualBox VMs are used:
- **Provisioning server** (`mast-prov-server`): standard Windows 10/11, runs `build-mast.ps1` and
  hosts the SMB `mast-staging` share. The `MAST_provisioning/` repo is mounted into it as a
  VirtualBox Shared Folder (`\\vboxsvr\mast-prov`) so edits on the Mac are immediately visible
  without any manual sync step.
- **Target** (`mast01`): Windows IoT, receives and executes the staged payload. Kept in a clean
  VirtualBox snapshot (`clean-state`) and restored after every failed attempt.

Both VMs share a VirtualBox host-only network (`192.168.56.0/24`) for VM-to-VM communication.
Each also has a NAT adapter for internet access.

**Implications:**
- Every provisioning attempt starts from a known-good snapshot — no manual wipe needed.
- Source edits on the Mac take effect on the next `build-mast.ps1` run with zero friction.
- The provisioning server VM only needs to be created once; it is long-lived.
- This architecture mirrors the real production topology (dedicated provisioning server →
  physical unit machines), so the dev loop exercises the actual code paths.

## [2026-05-04] VirtualBox Shared Folder over repo copy/sync

**Why:** The alternatives (copying files into the VM via SCP, using `rsync`, or a second git clone)
all require a manual sync step after every edit. During iterative debugging this creates friction and
risks stale files silently causing failures.

**What:** The Mac's `MAST_provisioning/` directory is mounted read-only into the provisioning server
VM as a VirtualBox Shared Folder. The build script is invoked with `-Top Z:\` pointing at the mount.
Asset binaries live in the same tree, so no separate staging of large files is needed.

**Implications:**
- The VM must have VirtualBox Guest Additions installed for shared folder support.
- The mount must be re-established after VM reboots (`net use Z: \\vboxsvr\mast-prov`). This can
  be automated with a startup script or by marking the share as persistent.
- The `staging/` output directory is written locally inside the VM (or to a separate writable path),
  not back into the shared folder, to avoid permission issues.

## [2026-05-04] Snapshot-based reset strategy

**Why:** Windows IoT does not have a quick "factory reset" that is reliable enough for repeated test
cycles. Manual cleanup after a partial provisioning run (uninstalling Python, removing registry keys,
deleting cloned repos) is error-prone and slow.

**What:** Before the first provisioning attempt, a VirtualBox snapshot called `clean-state` is taken
of the target VM immediately after `prepare-mast-client.ps1` completes successfully (hostname set,
`mast` user created, WinRM enabled). Subsequent resets are a three-command sequence on the Mac:
```bash
VBoxManage controlvm "mast01" poweroff
VBoxManage snapshot "mast01" restore "clean-state"
VBoxManage startvm "mast01" --type gui
```

A second snapshot (`post-prepare`) is taken after WinRM is confirmed working, so the prep step can
be skipped on all subsequent reset cycles.

**Implications:**
- Snapshot restore is fast (seconds), making tight iteration loops practical.
- The snapshot must be retaken if `prepare-mast-client.ps1` is modified.
- Disk space: each snapshot stores the delta from the base disk; expect 1–3 GB per snapshot for
  a lightly-used Windows IoT image.

## [2026-05-04] Module manifest design (module.json)

**Why:** Hard-coding the list of modules and their install commands in `build-mast.ps1` would make
adding or removing software require edits to the orchestrator itself, increasing the risk of
regressions across unrelated modules.

**What:** Each module is self-describing via a `module.json` manifest declaring:
- `order` — deterministic execution sequence (gaps intentional for insertion)
- `command` — the exact PowerShell command to run on the target
- `commandfiles` — files to stage (scripts + binary assets)
- `verify` — optional smoke-test command written to `*-smoke.txt` on pass

The build script reads all manifests and emits `commands.json` as the single artifact consumed by
the execution engine.

**Implications:**
- New modules require no changes to `build-mast.ps1` or `execute-mast-provisioning.ps1`.
- Order gaps (10, 20, 30 ...) allow insertion without renumbering.
- Assets are flattened into the staging root, so all module scripts share the same working directory
  during execution — module scripts must use unique asset filenames to avoid collisions.
